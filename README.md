#### Project Overview  
This project is focused on building a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system. The goal is to integrate a retrieval mechanism with a language generation model, enabling the system to provide accurate and context-aware responses to user queries. The system processes documents, retrieves the most relevant information based on user input, and uses a generation model to create well-formed responses.

#### Task Breakdown  
- Environment Setup (Dependencies)  
- Data Extraction Functions  
- Text Preprocessing (Normalization and Segmentation)  
- Retrieval System Development  
- Integration with Generation Model  
- Testing and Optimization  
- Documentation
